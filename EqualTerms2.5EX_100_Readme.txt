-- Other mods I like added --
Improved Living Quarters & Large Stores - https://openxcom.mod.io/improved-living-quarters-large-stores
UFO Vanilla Variants - https://openxcom.mod.io/ufo-vanilla-variants
Terrain Pack - https://openxcom.mod.io/terrain-pack (NOTE: TO USE THIS MOD, YOU WILL NEED TO MOVE THE COMPATIBILITY FILE INTO THE RULESET FOLDER)

The mod has three portions:

-= Wolfram Lance =-
The gunpowder tier weapons lack damage potential compared to later weapon technologies, but still have the highest cyclic rates in the game: firing more rounds per time-unit than other weapon classes. 

-= Coherency =- 
Laser weapons, while more potent and much more accurate in autofire modes than gunpowder weapons, are inferior in aimed accuracy to other weapon classes and lack the lethality of plasma weapons.

-= Fourth State =- 
Plasma weapons inflict incomparable damage, while lacking some of the accuracy or rate of fire compared to the other weapon types.

Overall, weapons have a certain amount of utility throughout the game, while still making upgrading technology levels worthwhile.  Because of this, researching the weapon technology trees now takes longer, to afford more utility to the earlier tiers.

The tier-list
0: Gunpower
0.5: Alloy
1: Laser
2: Plasma
3: In next "DLC" version 3.0
